\section{Conclusion}
 
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience implementing a variety of fluid simulation methods, including particle-based (SPH), grid-based (Stable Fluids), and hybrid approaches (PIC, FLIP, and APIC). We deepened our understanding of pressure projection, velocity interpolation, particle-grid transfers, and fluid behavior visualization. On the implementation side, we learned to work with OpenGL and GLUT for real-time rendering, and used the Eigen library for efficient linear algebra operations. We also practiced debugging and tuning numerical simulations, and managing complexity within a modular C++ codebase.

\textbf{Team Contributions}   Xu Chen was responsible for the OpenGL-based visualization system and implemented the APIC method. Yumeng He contributed to both the particle system and grid-based simulation components. Irene Li worked on particle and grid simulations. Yuchen Chen implemented the PIC and FLIP methods and also contributed to grid development.

\textbf{Future Work }   This project has sparked our interest in computer graphics and physically based animation. In the future, we hope to explore more advanced topics such as 3D fluid simulation, GPU acceleration, and real-time rendering techniques.
