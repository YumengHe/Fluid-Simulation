\subsection{APIC}
To implement the APIC method, we aimed to simulate incompressible fluid behavior with both stability and visual richness. Compared to PIC or FLIP, APIC introduces an affine velocity field per particle to better capture rotational and shear motion, which helps reduce excessive numerical dissipation and jittering effects.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

The core steps of the APIC method are summarized in Algorithm~\ref{alg:apic}. This method extends the standard PIC approach by introducing an affine velocity matrix for each particle, which allows capturing local rotational and shear motions more accurately.

\subsubsection{Intermediate Results and Diagrams}
We used the Affine Particle-in-Cell (APIC) method to simulate fluid with improved detail and stability. Each particle stores an affine velocity matrix, which allows local rotation and deformation to be preserved during particle-to-grid transfers.
